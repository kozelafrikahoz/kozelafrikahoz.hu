			<p class="children_data_page_text">Djigui lives in a big family indeed. His mother has 9 children, his father’s second wife has another 7 and they have 6 adopted children, as well. (Adopted children are usually distant relatives from the country who move up to town to be able to go to school.)<br><br>Djigui is 14 years old and is the forth best student in grade 7. His father is a gardener, his mother sells soup made of bones for the workers in the nearby slaughter house. 13 of their children go to school. The family is in great arears with school fees because the father, who used to be relatively well off,  cannot work as much as before due to his age and recent illness.<br><br>Djigui has an elder brother in university who can help him in his studies. He only has one torned literature book that he inherited from him. He doesn’t have any other school books. He speaks French well, he enjoyes studying. They have an old blackboard  that the children of the house use for studying.<br><br>They eat once a day, and occasionally he has a coin to buy some food snack for the school. His chore at home is to bring 80 L of water from the city tap home every day (for her mother’s soup).<br><br>Djigui would like to go to grammar school, then university. He would like to work as a trader. </p>
